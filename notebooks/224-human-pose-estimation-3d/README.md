# Title of Tutorial

This demo contains 3D multi-person pose estimation demo. Intel OpenVINOâ„¢ backend can be used for fast inference on CPU. This demo is based on Lightweight OpenPose and Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB papers. It detects 2D coordinates of up to 18 types of keypoints: ears, eyes, nose, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, as well as their 3D coordinates.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook uses the model to estimate human pose and draw them in 2-D screen. The input source can be video files or webcam.
