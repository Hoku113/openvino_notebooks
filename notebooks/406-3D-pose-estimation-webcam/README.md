*Binder is a free service where the webcam will not work, and performance on the video will not be good. For best performance, we recommend installing the notebooks locally.*

This demo contains 3D multi-person pose estimation demo. Intel OpenVINOâ„¢ backend can be used for fast inference on CPU. This demo is based on [Lightweight OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12004) and [Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03453) papers. It detects 2D coordinates of up to 18 types of keypoints: ears, eyes, nose, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, as well as their 3D coordinates.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook uses the model to estimate 3D human pose and draw them in 2D screen. The input source can be video files or webcam. It uses the [Three.js python api](https://pythreejs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html) to display 3D results to the browser.

You can find an introduction to the model [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/human-pose-estimation-3d-0001).

## Installation Instructions

If you have not done so already, please follow the [Installation Guide](../../README.md) to install all required dependencies.

Make sure your [Jupyter extension](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs#jupyterlab) is working properly. To avoid errors that may arise from the version of the dependency package, we recommend using the **Jupyterlab** instead of the Jupyter notebook to display image results.
