# 3D Human Pose Estimation with OpenVINO 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks.git/main?labpath=notebooks%2F406-3D-pose-estimation-webcam%2F406-3D-pose-estimation.ipynb)
*Binder is a free service where the webcam will not work, and performance on the video will not be good. For best performance, we recommend installing the notebooks locally.*

This demo contains 3D multi-person pose estimation demo. Intel OpenVINOâ„¢ can be used to accelerate the inference on multiple devices, such as CPU, GPU and VPU. The model used in this demo is based on [Lightweight OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12004) and [Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03453) papers. It detects 2D coordinates of up to 18 types of keypoints: ears, eyes, nose, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, as well as their 3D coordinates. These 3D coordinates of the keypoints could be used to construct the 3D display of the human poses. Also, this 3D display method could be extended to display other 3D models

## Notebook Contents

This notebook uses the model to estimate 3D human pose and draw them in 2D screen. The input source can be video files or webcam. It uses the [Three.js python api](https://pythreejs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html) to display 3D results to the browser.

You can find an introduction to the model [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/human-pose-estimation-3d-0001).

## Installation Instructions

If you have not done so already, please follow the [Installation Guide](../../README.md) to install all required dependencies.

Make sure your [Jupyter extension](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs#jupyterlab) is working properly. To avoid errors that may arise from the version of the dependency package, we recommend using the **Jupyterlab** instead of the Jupyter notebook to display image results.
